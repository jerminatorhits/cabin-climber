# Cabin Climber value proposition

## Relationship with seats.aero

**Cabin Climber and seats.aero solve different problems.**

| | Cabin Climber | seats.aero |
|---|---------------|------------|
| **Question** | How do I *get* enough points for Tokyo biz? | Where can I *book* with the points I have? |
| **When** | Months before the trip (earning phase) | When you're ready to book (search phase) |
| **Output** | A clear goal, card plan, and progress tracking | Live award availability across programs |

**Positioning:** “We help you earn and track. They help you search and book.” Send users to seats.aero when they’re ready to find flights; they come back to Cabin Climber to stay on plan and hit their number.

## Value props (why users need Cabin Climber)

1. **One goal, one number**  
   We give a single target (e.g. 75k one-way) and keep everything focused on Tokyo business. No “search everywhere for anything”—just “hit this number, then book.”

2. **Card strategy and bonus tracking**  
   Which cards to get, in what order, and how much to spend in how many months. Track each card’s bonus progress. seats.aero doesn’t help you earn; we do.

3. **Progress and motivation**  
   Goal + map + “You’re X% there” over months. Self-reported is fine—it’s your plan and your checklist. Bank sync can be a later upgrade.

4. **Curated for Tokyo biz**  
   Cards, programs, and examples are all chosen for this one redemption. Less overwhelm than generic points sites.

5. **“When to look”**  
   We can remind users: “You’re close to your goal—start checking seats.aero for ANA/United space.” That keeps us in the loop and frames seats.aero as the next step.

## Possible future value

- **Bank/account linking** — Auto-import points or spend (e.g. via Plaid or partner). “Sync your cards and we’ll track progress for you.”
- **Alerts** — “You’re $500 from your bonus” or “You hit your goal—time to search seats.aero.”
- **Booking timing tips** — “ANA often releases close-in; set a seats.aero alert for 2–4 weeks out.”

## Messaging on the site

- Hero: Real flights first (dream), then “we show you how to get the points.”
- Real Flights section: “See live availability” → seats.aero. Add one line: “When you’re ready to book, search there. We’re here to help you get the points.”
- “Why Cabin Climber” section: 3–4 bullets (goal + cards + progress + Tokyo-only).
- Avoid sounding defensive; sound complementary. “Get the points here. Book the flight there.”
